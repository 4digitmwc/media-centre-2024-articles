---

## **A Quick Recap…**

**The United States and the Philippines** are facing off against each other in the **Winner’s QFs** of **4DM 2024!** The US had steamrolled through Spain & Peru and had not **lost** a point so far heading into the QFs. The Philippines on the other hand, had just come off from a match against Italy, winning by a score of 6-2. These 2 teams have met **4 times** prior to this matchup in **previous 4DM tournaments.** The United States first defeated the Philippines back in **4DM1 & 4DM2** in the Winner’s Finals! But afterwards, both teams met up again in the Loser’s Semifinals in which the Philippines were able to avenge their 2 losses to eliminate the United States in **4DM3 & 4DM4!** After 4DM 2023 was the first time both teams didn’t run into each other, now we’re into 4DM 6/2024. This is the **5th time** these 2 teams will encounter each other! While no one will be eliminated from this tournament, this is a rivalry that has reignited and how this match has gone for both teams, **it’s like these 2 teams will fight where they left off from 4DM 4/2022!**

## **The Rundown**

The United States will protect **SV1 (sing sing red indigo)**, and the Philippines will protect **LN4 (Viden)**. For the first bans, the Philippines will ban **SV2 (Hito Mania)**, while the US will ban **LN5 (Tricolor Prizm***)**. With the Protects & Bans that are out of the way, the United States will choose **RC2 (Chili Sauce)**! The United States & Philippines both put on an impressive start to this battle, but a **break** from **ScoliosisET** is what the US needed, as the United States scored 2.986m points to take the first point off of the Philippines! **Tonels & charlie72** with the V1 SS for the United States! **Silicosis 2** will also take a V1 SS and the highest score for the Philippines but it wasn’t enough to be able to get the break point. **1-0 United States**

Following this pick, the Philippines first pick for this match will be **LN1 (world.execute(me))**! This matchup will start where it left off as during the first quarter, both teams were going **back and forth** with lead changes. It wasn’t until the first break that happened as **Soir0116** found the first break, giving the United States the lead. **[KN]Puddles** will find a 2nd drop, but **charlie72** will find a much worse combo break! Heading into the final kiai, both teams are neck and neck and it wasn’t until **- Sky -** drops at the final kiai, extending the lead and ultimately, the **point** as the Philippines will take their first point on LN1. Winning by almost 13k points! Despite **Tonels** having a V1 SS on LN1, **Silicosis 2** will take the top score in the lobby with 995k points. **1-1 Tie**

The United States will continue with their rice picks as they will pick **RC1 (D.O.S.E)**! The map starts off neck and neck, as the United States were slowly pulling away with the lead after the first quarter. But a crucial drop would happen from **ScoliosisET** for the Philippines after the halfway mark, as the Philippines couldn’t recover from the break. Giving the United States their 2nd point of the match. **2-1 United States**

The next map will be **LN2 (Barracuda)**! Up until the 3rd quarter, the Philippines was slowly, but surely extending their lead against the United States. Everybody was holding their Full Combos until **[KN]Puddles** broke with a quarter of a map to go! The score would flicker between the United States & the Philippines until the last second, when the Philippines narrowly held on to take their 2nd point to make it **2-2 Tie.**

Shortly after losing on LN4, the United States immediately went with **RC5 (Mint Tango)**! This is their 3rd rice map, and out of the 3 rice maps that have played so far, this map was **one-sided** from start to finish. As early breaks from **ScoliosisET & Soir0116** is what the United States needed as they started with a **good** lead, and ended with a **bigger** lead to take their 3rd point of the match. Despite **Silicosis 2** having the top score in the lobby with 996k (another V1 SS), the United States team performance was good enough to capitalize on **ScoliosisET & Soir0116** mistakes as they won by 26k points. **3-2 United States.**

Before their next pick, the Philippines has the opportunity to take their **2nd ban** of the match. Considering they went **0-3** on **RC maps**, it made sense as they decided to ban **RC4 (Slamurai)**! Now that’s out of the way, the Philippines has decided to go with **LN3 (Doctorine)**! The map starts off with both teams going neck and neck on the lead changes. And just when the Philippines was able to take a small lead by accuracy advantage, **Silicosis 2** would find a drop in the halfway mark! Giving the lead to the United States! However, the United States would lose their accuracy as **charlie72 & - Sky -** struggles to improve on their accuracy, slowly giving the **lead** back to the Philippines! And unfortunately for the United States, charlie72 would find a **drop** that would greatly extend the lead to the Blue team. The Philippines would be able to take this map, going **3-0** on **LN maps**, and therefore, making it **3-3 Tie.**

Before their next pick, the United States would be up to make their next ban! And they would ban **HB4 (lapse of memory**)! Afterwards, the United States would use their opportunity to pick their protect pick: **SV1 (sing sing red indigo)**! This map starts off with accuracy drops from both **[LS]Tenshi & ERA Basil**, but a break by **[LS]Tenshi** would give the way to the United States to take the lead and never look back. As the United States would win by over 100k points! **4-3 United States.**

Following this loss, the Philippines will choose their own protect pick: **LN4 (Viden)**! This map started off very contested for the lead as both teams were neck and neck with each other at the first quarter of the map. But accuracy drops from **- Sky - & charlie72** would extend the lead to the Philippines. And unlike the **last 2 LN maps**, the Philippines looked really **comfortable** on Viden. Slowly extending their lead to 8k before - Sky - lost the full combo. Giving the way to the Philippines to go **4-0 on LNs**. Taking the LN sweep to win LN4 by 27.8k points. **4-4 Tie.**

*(What the mappool looks like after 8 picks, and 4 bans)*

After 8 maps, both teams have one more map to pick before the dreaded tiebreaker! Considering the United States are **3-0** on **RC maps**, the United States would go with **RC3 (one of none)**! In the start, **z2a** had dropped **multiple 200s**, giving an early lead to the Philippines! Things didn’t look much better as **Tonels** would find a drop on the halfway mark, extending the lead to the Philippines by **23k points**! Before a crucial break by **[KN]Puddles** would decrease the Philippines lead, and a **second** [KN]Puddles break would cut the lead close! But luckily for the Philippines, [KN]Puddles broke within the **last 15 seconds**, just not enough time for the United States to make a comeback. Giving the Philippines their first and only **break point** of the match! **Silicosis 2** with a V1 SS, getting 997k and top score in the lobby. **5-4 Philippines**

Shortly after the break point, the Philippines has their first and only opportunity to try to avoid a tiebreaker with **Match Point** in their hands! But with **no LNs or RCs maps left**, the Philippines must play a **HB map**! And their HB pick of the match will be **HB2 (Oxygen Destroyer)**! This pick would backfire from the start, as **Soir0116 and [KN]Puddles** would drop combos at the first quarter mark! And once the United States got an initial lead of **16k points**, they never let it go as **Tonels, charlie72, & - Sky -** would get a team score of 2.963m points to be able to take back a break point, **making it 5-5 tie with the tiebreaker left to go!**

***All things must come to an end again.*** As the **Tiebreaker: UMBRA, RADIOLOGOS.** is the final map that both teams must play after 1 hour and 34 minutes of playtime! **The United States will go with Tonels, charlie72, & - Sky -. The Philippines will send Silicosis 2, [KN]Puddles, & Soir0116 to play the tiebreaker.** 5 Minutes and 55 seconds of the map. Here we go!

Right off the gate, it’s not a good start for the US as **Tonels & charlie72** would find drops at the start and **- Sky -** not having a good start in terms of **accuracy**, giving a lead to the Philippines. Philippines got off to a hot start, and despite a break happening from [KN]Puddles, a **2nd charlie72 break** would help extend the lead to the Philippines, as they extend the lead to 9k points. **Consistency problems** would arise for **Tonels, charlie72, [KN]Puddles, & Soir0116** as despite the supporting duo breaking over on the Philippines, they would find themselves leading by **13k points** in the first quarter. This is where things get interesting from there. **After the first quarter**, the Philippines struggled to keep up with consistency as **Silicosis 2 would drop his Full Combo!** and from there, **the Philippines had struggled with consistency!** as the entire team would have more breaks, including a **team reset** in which the score got cut down by **under 1000 points**, before a Tonels break buys the Philippines some time as they are able to rebuild their lead by **5k points after the first half.**

Heading into the 2nd half, a break from Silicosis 2 would slowly start decreasing their lead. And a break from [KN]Puddles on a burst pattern would reduce the score lead to 3k points. Before a Soir0116 would cut the lead very close as **for the first time on this map, we’re seeing a flicker lead back and forth from both teams!** A Tonels break would help extend the Philippines lead, but Soir0116 would trade a break, **giving the United States their first lead in the map with under a minute left to go heading into the final LN section!** But, tragedy strikes as charlie72 would find **multiple breaks** on the **final section** of the Tiebreaker. **Despite a full combo performance from - Sky -**, and everyone performing to their absolute best with fatigue on their fingers, and nerves at an all time high, the Philippines would ultimately pull away at the end. As they were able to defeat the United States by 7k points in the map. **The Philippines would defeat the United States by a score of 6-5.**

## **Match Summary**

The Philippines have won the Winner’s QFs match against the United States. In the last 3 matches these 2 teams faced off, each of the last 3 matches would go all the way to tiebreaker.

**And when it came down to the map that mattered the most**

...the Philippines was able to outperform the United States on the final map. This was a match where everyone truly performed beyond everyone’s expectations on a good match. Definitely not only the QF’s Match of the Week, but also arguably the match of the tournament, perhaps even of 4DM as a whole. And regardless of which team had won or lost this match, both teams can be proud of themselves knowing they’ve put on a show for the ages.

**And if there’s one thing we can all learn from this, is that the United States & Philippines rivalry is far from over…**
