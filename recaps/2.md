## **A Quick Recap…**

**The road to top 6** continues for both teams eager to make their **first finals** appearance. As **Italy** and **Indonesia** are facing each other in this **conditional SFs match** after their first matches. Both Italy & Indonesia came off from **victories** against the **United Kingdom & Canada retrospectively by a score of 6-1**. Indonesia had **been** in the SFs week before back in **4DM 2022**, but this is the **furthest** they’ve ever made in the bracket with the win against Canada. **This is Italy’s first appearance in the SFs alone**. And just like Indonesia, Italy has made their furthest in the tournament with the win against the UK. Both teams are playing for history for their country’s pride. **Regardless of the result, both teams will finish in the Top 8**. But it’s obvious that these 2 teams want to keep going all the way to the end. Regardless of what happens, these 2 teams will give everything they got!

## **The Rundown**

**Indonesia** won the **roll battle** against **Italy**. Indonesia will first protect **RC3 (Magicrash Ice)**! And Italy will also protect a RC map: **RC2 (MAMA)**! For the bans, Italy will ban **SV1 (Speculation)**, while Indonesia will ban **LN2 (Time to say goodbye)**! Indonesia will start off the match with **HB1 (AGEN WIDA)**! **Indonesia** has played this map before, scoring **2.960m points** against Canada to win that point. Indonesia will have a nice start on the map due to a **break** from **[SPNG]Sib3riaN** for Italy, and Indonesia **never gave up the lead** as Indonesia cruised to their first point. **Wishtynite** with the top score of 992k points. And Indonesia will improve on their HB1 score by about 1k points. **1-0 Indonesia.**

Following HB1, Italy will now be up to pick **RC1 (snake)**! Italy played this map previously, scoring **2.946m points** against the United Kingdom. Both teams start off the map neck and neck with each other, but **Rakanovan** will find a drop on his performance, giving the lead to Italy. **Wishtynite** will find a 2nd drop for Indonesia, extending Italy’s lead to 33k points m. However, **angela202133** finds a **chain break**, cutting the lead down to 6k points! But the map is over and Italy held off a late comeback from Indonesia to take their first point. **ricetoasty** & **24Marzo** scores a **duo average of 989k points**, occupying the **Top 2** scores in the lobby. **1-1 Tie.**

After this, Indonesia picks the only SV map in the lobby: **SV2 (fffff)**! **Indonesia** had **won** this map against Canada, scoring **2.890m points**, while **Italy** **lost** this SV map against the United Kingdom, in which Italy scored **2.728m points**. This was a **great pick** for Indonesia as the team of **Reihynn, Wishtynite, and nayuu** looked really comfortable, having the accuracy advantage in their favor. Leading by 57k points, **nayuu drops but antony88fayah would trade back**. Extending the lead as Indonesia comfortably takes their 2nd point by 87k points. **2-1 Indonesia.**

Italy would respond back going with their protect pick: **RC2 (MAMA)**! Starting off the map, **nayuu** would find an early drop, but **angela202133** would find a break shortly after, giving the lead to Indonesia. Heading into the **first kiai**, **nayuu** and **ricetoasty** both get breaks, but afterwards, both teams have stabilized as everyone is holding their combos until **nayuu** broke at the end of the **2nd kiai**! Giving the lead to Italy as the map calms down, but **ricetoasty** finds another break, giving a small lead back to **Indonesia**. But **Wishtynite** finds his first break on the map! As Italy regains the lead before the final kiai, **angela202133** finds their 2nd break for Italy! Giving our **5th lead change** of the map as Indonesia occupied the lead heading into the **final kiai**! Indonesia and Italy are going neck and neck, but a **break** from **nayuu** within the last 10 seconds is what **Italy** needs as they take over the lead, and ultimately, the point. **24Marzo** and **Rakanovan** both have FCs for their retrospective teams. And despite **Rakanovan** having the highest score of 991k, Italy had a **better supporting** lineup that was able to outperform Indonesia’s supporting lineup in the end. **2-2 Tie.**

After Italy’s protect pick, Indonesia chose **HB4 (VANTABLACK RAVER)** as their next map! Neither team has played this map previously, and this pick may have *backfired* on Indonesia. The map starts off with Italy having a **strong start on accuracy**, and a break from **Wishtynite** doesn’t help Indonesia’s chances of a comeback as Italy was holding off Indonesia with a 17k point lead, and that’s what Italy needed as they take their first break point off from Indonesia! **[SPNG]Sib3riaN** will get the top score for Italy with 992k points. **3-2 Italy.**

Before picking their next map, Indonesia has a opportunity to **ban** a map from Italy before making their next pick. The map that will be banned is **LN3 (Giant Steps)**. Now that Italy is up, they chose **RC4 (Meant to be)**! Italy played this map previously, scoring **2.950m points** to defeat Canada on Meant to be. The map starts off with a early break from **Rakanovan**, before a **double break** from **angela202133 & 24Marzo** gives the lead to Indonesia, but nayuu will break shortly afterwards. Giving the lead back to Italy. **24Marzo** will find his 2nd break, giving the lead to Indonesia! And just as when Indonesia is about to take their break point back, nayuu will break within **3 seconds left to go**! Giving the lead back to Italy with not much time left, extending Italy’s lead in the match! **4-2 Italy.**

Trying to avoid going down 5-2, Indonesia’s next map will be **LN5 (Seiren ~Hisou no Tategoto~)**! Indonesia scored **2.931m points** previously against Canada. Italy just couldn’t capitalize on this map, as breaks from **antony88fayah & angela202133** is what **Indonesia** needs to get themselves back into the race as they improved their team score from **2.931m to 2.944m points**! **4-3 Italy.**

Before the next map, Italy has the opportunity to ban another map from the mappool! Italy would ban **LN4 (idola)**. After that ban, Italy would pick **RC5 (Wolves Standing Towards Enemies)**! This pick from Italy didn’t start off well as **antony88fayah** would find a break, and a double break from **antony88fayah & angela202133** would extend Indonesia’s lead! And despite a **team reset** that happened from **Indonesia**, Italy couldn’t **capitalize** and respond with **more breaks**. Evening out the score gap that Indonesia would take a break point back, as they defeat Italy on RC5 by 17k points! **4-4 Tie.**

*(What the mappool looked like after 8 picks, and 4 bans)*

Going from 4-2 to 4-4, Indonesia’s last map will be **HB2 (Rush-Hour)**! Indonesia will not opt to use their **protect pick** earlier when they **protect RC3**. **iSxga & nayuu** would begin the map with breaks, giving Italy the lead before **antony88fayah** trade back a break. iSxga would find another break, but Italy would lose the remaining FCs from **angela202133 & [SPNGSib3riaN**! Another combo break from angela202133 & [SPNG]Sib3riaN would seal the deal as Indonesia gains their 5th point, reclaiming their lead in the match! **5-4 Indonesia.**

After being up 4-2, Italy has lost the last 3 maps. And in order to avoid elimination, Italy’s last map will be **HB3 (Ichirin)**! Both teams have won that map against their retrospective opponents, but Italy has a **21k point advantage** over Indonesia after their first attempts. Both teams are neck and neck for the first half, until a **double break** from Indonesia happened as **Rakanovan & Wishtynite** lost their FCs, giving a big lead to Italy! **angela202133** would find a break towards the end but there wasn’t enough time for Indonesia to catch up. As Italy would be able to beat Indonesia on **HB3**, being able to **avoid a 4-0 run** from Indonesia to force **Tiebreaker!**

***It all comes down to who wants it the most.*** As the tiebreaker: **ResolvE -means to an end-** will be the final map that Italy & Indonesia will have to play. As Italy will field with **[SPNG]Sib3riaN, angela202133, & antony88fayah** to play this map. Meanwhile, Indonesia will go with **Rakanovan, iSxga, & nayuu** to play the tiebreaker. **Both teams are eyeing their first finals appearance in 4DM, but in the end, only 1 can prevail.** And after 1 hour and 26 minutes of the match so far, the tiebreaker shall commence.

**The tiebreaker starts off with both teams being neck and neck**! **antony88fayah and iSxga** will find breaks for their retrospective teams. But Italy pulls through with the lead! Italy will lose the **remaining FCs** shortly after as **angela202133 and [SPNG]Sib3riaN** both find breaks! **Rakanovan** breaks as well as **iSxga**, and despite Italy’s being **inconsistent** comparing to Indonesia, their **accuracy** is what making Italy still holding on to the lead! **nayuu** will break before the halfway mark, and Italy will find themselves in the lead with 14k points as we head into the **second half**.

**The theme for the tiebreaker right now is Italy is outperforming on accuracy, but consistency is their concern as the entire team drops their combos!**

This lead has been cut down from **14k to 2k points**, but **nayuu** and **iSxga** will also drop their combos, but before you know it, **Italy is still holding on to their lead**! A lot of drops are happening between 5 players, but **Rakanovan** is holding on to his combo since the second half! Indonesia is closing in on the lead and they needs a few more breaks from Italy to take the lead this late in the map. But then: **heartbreak**. **Rakanovan** drops his combo and the score lead goes back to Italy as they extend their lead from **2k to 9k points**. **Italy’s accuracy game was strong enough to hold off Indonesia’s consistency as Italy would take the final point of the match.** **Italy will defeat Indonesia by a score of 6-5.**
