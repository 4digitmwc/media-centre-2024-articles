# 4DM24 Ro16 Interviews ft. Spain, Brazil, & Philippines!

***Spain***

**So, first off, it's a painful way to go out on a close match like this. So I want to bring up that during your 2nd pick, you guys decided to go with an SV2 pick that Brazil protected. What was the reasoning behind it and did you guys think that may not have been the right choice?**

cartografiar: To be honest, we don't know either. I chose it mainly because I wanted lv3 to play. Maybe we weren't hoping to win the match so maybe it's that.

[AR]lv3plane: If we have White Hare we might have a chance to win a pick but we didn't have them

cartografiar: Yea, that's true. Our SV players are lv3plane, White Hare, and me. So we were missing an important player

**I see. Regardless, Spain was able to make up for the mistake on SV2, and you guys were able to take it to tiebreaker! What did you guys learn from this match that you guys will take in the future?**

cartografiar: I suck at LNs. I need to grind more LN release and acc.

Adr053: I need to stay calm while I'm playing.

ERA Minikrimi: I personally took it as a mental test more than anything, the situation of being up against the ropes and managing that pressure is something I'm always really grateful for being in since it helps me grow up as a tourney player.

Adrig3: We should get a more stable composition imo. I think it's safe to say we were pretty good at rice maps on this match but our LNs/SVs were horrible. We should also organize a little bit better, knowing if we are going to be able to play when we sign up because we missed players on both this and the previous match, but you never know.

cartografiar: Yes, our biggest error is organization.

**I think this team has a bright future ahead, so for my final question, will Spain come back stronger and will you guys return as better players for other teams to watch out for next year?**

cartografiar: If I'm not 3 digit next year or skill banned next year, sure. I hope for the best to all the other players that are remaining for next year and for the new ones that are coming as well.

Adr053: I will be more stronger after this match. So I think I will play next year.

ERA Minikrimi: I’d love to play next year (and maybe be capt :pray:) so if I'm not retired you can count me in for the next iteration whenever it drops.

[AR]lv3plane: For me, I will definitely try to improve on everything because I probably can’t play the full Mania course with only SV lmao. I’ve only been active on mania for just over a year so the road ahead of me is still very long!

Adrig3: Personally, this is my final day playing osu!, i planned to play this tournament as a goodbye to the game and the community, life goes on after all (and the skillban list also updates), however, i'll still be around between my friends in the community, wishing all the best to the future generations :fist: Let's bring it on next year :fire:

**I love the optimistic future and I can’t wait to see what Spain will accomplish. Adrig, thanks for everything you’ve done for the game. Your performances have made your country proud of you. But that will be it from me! Best of luck in the future! Muchas Gracias!**

Adrig3: Gracias a ti jefe!

[AR]lv3plane: Tysm!

Adr053: Thank you!

***Brazil***

**How are you guys doing?**

1Nuttelinha1: Fine I guess.

zKuri: Good.

soutin & MORDEST68: Great!

Namirin-chan: A bit nervous, but good lol.

**First off, congratulations on winning your Ro16 match against Spain! This was a very tough matchup from start to finish. Considering Brazil just played their 2nd TB in this tournament, could I get your thoughts on your victory?**

zKuri: I’m feeling good, and I'm happy to be playing the first match of the tournament. I've never felt so much adrenaline playing osu!

1Nuttelinha1: To be honest, I thought we would have lost the TB due to their performance on the entire match, when I got the miss (I think was in the middle of the TB), I was already screaming "WE LOST XDD WE LOST''. I didn't have leaderboard on, so I just kept playing thinking I mess up the match.

soutin: Spain had a really strong rice team and we couldn't get a point on that off from them. But when we were choosing the players for the roster we wanted to prioritize our LN team. Our team overall is very strong in the LNs, not so much on rice and we have an ok SV roster.

Up until now, we haven't won a single rice point, which is pretty sad and is the main reason why we played 2 TBs so far. But I'm confident that with a more hard rice pool in the later stages, we can perform better compared to the other teams. Also, I think the win helped with our team morale a lot lmao.

Namirin-chan: ngl, I confess that I'm very relieved, that was our second tiebreaker in a row and it was very tough. I think I've played more TBs in two weeks than in years of osu tournaments lol.

**So last year, Brazil finished in 4th place in 4DM23. Considering what we’re seeing is a rebuilding year, what have you guys learned from this tournament and how will you guys use this experience to grow as mania players as the tournament progresses?**

soutin: I think that this year's 4DM for me was very humbling. I've always taken the idea of our roster being top-seed and performing well for granted. It makes me appreciate how good our previous roster players were. It also inspires me to get better and get as good as they were in tournament play.

This year we have me and Namirin as veterans. Everyone else is completely new to tournaments. Most of the people who used to play in the previous years aren't playing anymore.

About our new players, I am very confident that they'll take this 4DM as a learning experience and continue to grow and become big contenders for strong players in future tournaments.

1Nuttelinha1: the 4DM23 Brazil's Team was definitely very stacked, compared with our new team of this year, I would say we still missing some skills and training to reach the "Being a threat" team, it is not something this thing of "New Player not being a Threat" because we don't know each other, unless you already played other tournaments. For me as a Mania player, with all the things I've learned, is to never give up, and always try again.

zKuri: Being my first tournament (literally), I hope to learn a lot so that maybe, in the next 4DMWC, I can be better than I am today (If I’m not skillban next time :p).

After this match, I see how fun and full of adrenaline a tournament is and I hope to be able to participate in more :>

Some may give us the impression that we are not going that far, but I sincerely hope that we can prove otherwise.

Namirin-chan: Our old members either stopped competing or were banned, so we had no choice but to have a "completely new" roster (because soutin and I have already played other editions).

*(soutin on 4DM4/4DM22 Brazil roster)*

Compared to our past results, which weren't bad, I believe we are performing below expectations but not because we are weak, but because our opponents are super strong.

**So next up, you guys will take on Sweden! And assuming you win vs Sweden, you’ll face either Chile or Germany in the conditional round. Any thoughts on how Brazil will approach the QFs week? Especially since the pool is going to hit into the mid-game mappool style**

1Nuttelinha1: Assuming we win against the Sweden's team (will be hard, but not impossible), we will probably keep with the LN side and HB, but if we get into semi,  rice will be a option, since our rice team is more late game than early/mid game

soutin: Sweden will be a very tough opponent. But we're still confident that we will also be a very tough opponent for them. Very high chances for a third TB!!!

If we play against Sweden, the momentum and morale of the team will be very high, and I think we can ride that for a very good placing.

I also believe the fact that we are in the middle of an underdog run also helps with our mental.

Sweden surely seems like the stronger team compared to Chile or Germany, but if this 4DM taught me something is to never doubt your opponent, so I'm very excited to see what is going to happen.

zKuri: I think I would rest in peace. Just kidding!

I would be very happy if our team reached the semi-finals. My dream was to reach at least this stage of the tournament, and I hope we can do it.

I trust this wonderful team that Brazil is :)

I will do my best so that our team can achieve the best scores at every RC, HB, LN and SV maps.

I'm not good with words to answer such questions so I hope you understand hehe.

1Nuttelinha1: I can see our next match against Sweden going to TB, but only time and nerves can tell the results.

Namirin-chan: I believe that Sweden will not be an easy match. Our team gets stronger the more time passes and I would like to say that the difficult part is over, but I know that's not the case.

soutin: Also, we are hoping that the more difficult pool from QFs will match better with our strengths as a team. I wouldn't say our early game is our strong point, so reaching the mid-game of the tournament is a relief.

**Alrighty, that’s it from me. Thank you guys for answering these questions and best of luck on QFs! Obrigado!**

soutin & MORDEST68: Thank you!

zKuri: Thank você <3

***Philippines***

**Kumusta na kayo! How is everyone here doing?**

Jarod2396: I'm doing great

[LS]liadayo: I’m doing amazing yeah!

CuB-03: Good :))

**So congratulations on your victory against Italy! This was a match that went 6-2 in which you guys controlled most of the match. Could I get your thoughts on how the match went for everyone?**

CuB-03: To be honest, I popped off that match!

Nerves were not showing up that much which led to an accuracy skillboost, a little cold but still performed really great

[LS]liadayo: I think it went pretty well! Though we did have unfortunate things happen, we managed to pull through :D

Jarod2396: I kind of underperformed but got back up a bit. At least we won:))

**(To CuB-03 since he's here only), so Philippines has an interesting roster this year. You are returning from 4DM22 (or 4DM4), and Tenshi & Soir0113 (aka maniadegengod) are returning from last year's Philippines roster. I've noticed your pop off performances in tournaments like PHNM 2023, so I have 2 questions for you, 1) Was there a reason behind your absence in 4DM23 and did it help you improve massively comparing from 4DM22 to 4DM24? and 2) What has changed from the Philippines from 4DM22 to 4DM24 that has put this country back into the conversation of being a threat to win it all this year?**

CuB-03: 1) Well, the main reason I wasn't able to participate in 4DM23 is that i just farmed too much :p, though that did give me an extra year to improve and perform better for future tournaments, such as this one (4DM24)

2) I think something that has changed in the PH team from 4DM22 to 24 is that we’re more consistent, and our players definitely have the raw skill to complement their further improvement in other aspects of the game such as accuracy and control. We have amazing players such as [KN]Puddles and Soir0116 (formerly known as ManiaDegenGod) who are cracked in accuracy and early/mid-game, and there's Jarodpog and [LS]Liadayo, and [LS]Tenshi who have shown so much potential as late game carries. Our roster back in 4DM22 lacked in the late-game capabilities, but this roster for sure can fix that gap.

**As we approach the mid-game section of the tournament, you'll be facing off against the United States! This is a rematch from the Loser's SFs in 4DM22, where this country has stunned the #1 United States by winning via tiebreaker. But this time, it's Seed #4 vs #5, so it's going to be a evenly matched competition. How will you guys prepare for this rematch against the team that is seeking revenge on you guys for the damage on 4DM22?**

*(4DM4/4DM22: Philippines defeats United States via Tiebreaker in Loser’s SFs)*

[LS]liadayo: It's gonna be a very hype match. We will practice a lot harder this week.

Jarod2396: This match will be insane. And kind of terrifying, so a lot of practice is needed here, and some prep.

CuB-03: This one's going to be a very very close match, but we'll definitely make sure to practice a lot (not too much, or else mindblock)

**if that's all, then that's all from me! Thank you guys so much for answering these questions and best of luck on your QFs match! Salamat po! Mahal na kita!**

CuB-03: Thank you!

Jarod2396: Luv u too pork!

CuB-03: SHOUTOUT KAY DYEI

Philippines: DYEI BUFF!
