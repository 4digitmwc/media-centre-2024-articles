# 4DM QFs Interviews ft. Taiwan, Indonesia, & Germany

**Taiwan**

**So congratulations on winning against the United Kingdom! This was a match that went all the way to the tiebreaker. Can I get your thoughts on your victory?**

**-Veloce-:** Pretty happy not going to lie, but I've never thought of going on TB with the United Kingdom.

**amano_hina:** One of our players was not in good condition, and the game was very thrilling. We once allowed the opponent to get a match point, but I am very happy that we were able to secure the victory in the end.

**-Veloce-:** And the player was diablorex xD

**diablorex1234:**

**Hanson351:** He was nervous, and I haven't played any match since Ro32.

**(To amano_hina) So you're the only player returning from Taiwan from 4DM23. What is the biggest difference you saw from Taiwan that has made this team massively improve from 2023 to 2024?**

**amano_hina:** I think the difference is that we get some very good players, I think they will be super good at this game. These players have fully improved our abilities in all aspects. So we can now pick maps confidently, this is very different from last year.

**So for everyone here, next up you will be facing Malaysia. What is Taiwan's expectations for this match against a top team in the tournament?**

**-Veloce-:** Hope Diablorex1234 never choke again. And hope we don't get fucked on LNs.

**amano_hina:** Actually we think this will be a tough match for us, but we think we still have a tiny chance to win. Hope we will do better than our match this week, and get points as much as possible.

**Shice2566:** I hope we can at least secure one point from Malaysia; this will be a very challenging match.

**Indonesia**

**Okay. First off, how are you guys doing?**

**iSxga:** Doing well, despite the fact i had a shit session right after the match LOL

**Rakanovan:** Doing well after that clean win, other than that im starving

**Reihynn:** The euphoria has died down but I still feel really pumped

**Wishtynite:** I'm doing great but tired because I usually sleep at this time. I still have the euphoria

**nayuu:** my nerves were really kicking on the last 3 match, but I'm doing great

**So congratulations on getting past the Loserâ€™s QFs! You guys defeated Mexico and Japan to advance to the SFs! Considering that you did lose against China but looked strong, did you guys learn from the China match that helps carry over to QFs week?**

**Reihynn:** Personally, none since I don't really play anything other than sv, but the loss definitely helped us to get back in the game and practice to be our best.

**iSxga:** I don't think we got anything from China's match since we all mainly just had technical issues and a lack of practice on the pool.

**Wishtynite:** I learned to at least clean my keyboard first the day before the match. I didnâ€™t want another Ro16 RC3 incident. Hopefully, I don't jinx myself.

**Rakanovan:** Honestly, I think after that loss we became more motivated because we're one match away from getting knocked out of the tourney. There are still a bit minor oopsies here and there but overall we just increase our practices/preparations.

**nayuu:** from my perspective, I was trying to MA/PA everything so nerves got to me. I think it's just about how to control your nerves and not to try to MA or PA anything just like Ettiene's documentary said. Iâ€™m still working on that, but yeah it did help me quite.

**To iSxga & Reihynn, you 2 are the only players returning from your retrospective Indonesiaâ€™s rosters (iSxga: 4DM23, Reihynn: 4DM22). What is the difference between the previous rosters to this yearâ€™s rosters that made you guys this good?**

**iSxga:** I think we have more people who are all-rounders, so we generally just have more people to turn back on for back up.

**Reihynn:** In 4DM22, our team was waaaaaaayyyyyy too focused on SV. We lacked players, since one was an SV specialist and the other got an injury that made him quit. I was also really struggling back then on midgame since the skill level was so high. This year, the skill level is WAY higher than what I can do, so I'm really thankful to have teammates that are well-rounded so we can actually cover all of the skillsets. I came to this tourney to do early game rice, idk how I became sv main.

**So for the third time, Indonesia will be back in the SFs! You will be facing Canada, and then you may take on the United Kingdom/Italy. Thoughts on your opponents for the SFs week and do you guys believe Indonesia will make it to the finals week for the first time?**

**Rakanovan:** Hell yeah! I hope so.

**iSxga:** Oh shoot, weâ€™re facing Canada? :sob:

**Wishtynite:** I really hope so

**Reihynn:** This is really tough since I'd be facing my friends next week. Iâ€™m looking forward to playing against them. Although the UK and CAN would be tough. Also, I really hope we can advance to the finals, despite other teams also doing equally as well, I think anything can happen at any point.

**Wishtynite:** if we will be facing the UK, then good luck epic man 2!

**nayuu:** Definitely looking forward to facing them, Canada and the UK were pretty consistent tbh I'm scared.

But we'll prepare for the best and hopefully could recreate what Indonesia's MWC Player did last year!

**Germany**

**So this was not the greatest way to go out for Germany. You guys had won your first match against Chile, but in the conditional match, against Brazil, this match had gone all the way to TB, but in the end, Brazil prevailed. What was Germanyâ€™s mindset coming into the week and did you guys have hopes that youâ€™ll make it through the SFs?**

**ERA Medium Kek:** Well, our mindset for most matches was to try our best but most importantly have fun doing so, it was a bit dampened by the fact that we only had 4 players that weekend though, we all knew it was very doable but Drach being injured and Niko gone was a hard pill to swallow, so I'm definitely happy with our performance, but sad we didn't reach semis with such an insane squad.

Could have been Germanyâ€™s first semis placement ever in an international mania tournament.

**ERA Sirbeyy:** Brazil was definitely a tough opponent, they were very consistent across the board.

**Blacku1:** My performance was unfortunately subpar that weekend,Â  I was really tired from playing and kinda dragged the team down tbh.

**Crqstalized7:** Like medium kek mentioned earlier, our team faced some unfortunate absences. I was unable to play due to a hand injury (feeling discomfort even outside of gameplay), and Niko was occupied that day. Nevertheless, Brazil didn't falter and put up a good fight that led us to a tiebreaker. Although the match was winnable, Brazil consistently achieved incredible scores, with zKuri delivering an incredible FC on the tiebreaker. We had hoped to advance beyond Semi-Finals but unfortunately, we didn't succeed.

**Regardless, this has been Germanyâ€™s best performance in a mania international competition! So did you guys learned anything from this iteration that will help you all develop into better players in the future?**

**ERA Medium Kek:** Germany needs more ln players. I'll say though that it showed me that I need to grind acc and consistency again, my physicality was this time actually enough to keep up but I did choke quite a bit

**Lotex09:** I surely need to train LN and early game acc.

**Crqstalized7:** The tournament has highlighted areas where I still have much room for improvement. My goal is to secure a spot on the team again in 2025. And hopefully in 2025, I will be much better than this year.

**Blacku1:** I realized that I have lots to work on and that I want to focus more on 5k-7k

**Niko_Plays:** I feel like I learned to keep my calm a bit more during matches which is definitely useful. I choked a lot less than I did in past tournaments.

**Lotex09:** We need more SV Players.

What is the future of Germanyâ€™s mania scene going to look like? This country has a great active community so Iâ€™m curious to see if the growth could potentially lead into a long term plan that will see this country finally triumph to the top.

**ERA Medium Kek:** My personal plan was always to stay. As long as Germany didn't had at least a single top 3 finish. So expect me to stay a little longer :P

But the community is growing fast with new players like pikayume or ksnhsk improving really fast (or already insane players like Blacku1 just out-speeding me in improvement lmao) so I might not stay in the team as a player, but always as a coach

The ultimate plan is to always go one match further each year like in MWC.

2021: no win

2022: 1 win

2023: 2 wins

Surely this will continue

Oh and I also host a yearly german speaking regional, aka I'm also training the new gen up :3c

**Niko_Plays:** There seem to be new German players getting into the game and building up great skill which is really nice to see. Only a few years ago, the German mania community was rather small (I remember us participating in MWC 2020 with a 4 player lineup ðŸ˜…). I'm sure there is big potential if everyone tries their best to further improve in the game and push their limits.

**Crqstalized7:**

We have a lot of people in Germany who seem to prevail, and I believe Germany holds the potential to rise to the top in the near future
