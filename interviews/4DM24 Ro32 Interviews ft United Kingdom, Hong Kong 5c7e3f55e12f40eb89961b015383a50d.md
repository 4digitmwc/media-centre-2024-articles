# 4DM24 Ro32 Interviews ft. United Kingdom, Hong Kong, & Japan!

Subhead: Hear the thoughts of the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, & Japan after their victories in their Ro32 matches! And their thoughts on their Ro16 opponents in Thailand, Taiwan, & Vietnam!

United Kingdom

**I am here with the United Kingdom! How is everyone here doing?**

[ will ]: I’m doing amazingly

H1Pur: Doing good.

epic man 2: I’m doing great. :)

*_S*quiddy_: I'm incredibly glad that my research on the opponent teams were genuinely helpful! I was so afraid it was all gibberish that contributed to nothing for the few days leading up to the match.

[ will ]: Squiddy came with that professional response

H1Pur: Looks like squiddy has interview experience

epic man 2: I also have interview experience. Cogito ergo swim

**So first off, congratulations on facing against #22 Romania! Any thoughts of how the match went for you guys for this week?**

H1Pur: i think we had a few slip ups and the unfortunate bancho moment killing two Romanian players and stream all in one but overall it went well for us

_Squiddy_: I'm surprised. I guessed correctly that the result would be a 1-5 all the way back on Monday.

I'm a little disappointed that the match couldn’t be streamed due to game server scuff, and I told a few friends to watch our match live too :(. It went mostly as expected imo, though I did underperform significantly on the only map I played.

H1Pur: You didn't underperform. You’re doing exactly what's needed and that's great.

[ will ]: It did go pretty well for us but like H1Pur said already it was quite unfortunate with the whole bancho issues taking place but as a time I think we did great!

–Dragon–: In the grand scheme, it went really well as a team we felt really confident in our picks we had a good strategy and overall we were just consistent enough to take the win

romania did great though they had some really good rice scores.

epic man 2: I think for me, the match went quite exceptional given that I was eagerly waiting to play the maps let alone playing well -- in qualifiers I figured that Romania was in the top 5 seed for rice maps, so it was surprising to me that my accuracy on the rice maps (Namely Mid-Air Heatstroke, kiss the sexy robot, brbyjpusr2vip, etc) and in other fields ended up being equal to theirs throughout. Especially with my nerves acting before it begun, lol

-Dragon–: Yeah, my nerves really came out on the first map.

[ will ]: My nerves were off the bloody scale. It was my first time doing anything like this.

_Squiddy_: We got lucky that we faced Romania so early on in the tournament. if we faced them during quarters or semis it could be an entirely different story...

H1Pur: Yeah Romania is a late game monster. I’m glad we were lucky enough to face them early

–Dragon–: if they get to quarterfinals, they can do really well. I’m predicting they can reach SFs tbh.

_Squiddy_: Lucky matchup...though we have to face Thailand and then *maybe* Taiwan later.

It’s hard to be optimistic about that.

**(To H1Pur, Dragon, & epic man 2) What’s the difference with the roster you guys assembled last year to this year and how will you guys approach this tournament?**

–Dragon–: I think overall, our team was definitely much more well rounded this year.

Last year, we had a much more rice focused team, but this year we really have been able to make a really good quality team in every area.

epic man 2: I feel like the difference with the roster this year is that although we definitely had some great rice players last year (Usie, Asukai, etc), we now have a bit more of a balance now thanks to that we have introduced some new faces into the team, especially in the LN field which we would have struggled in last year in contrary.

H1Pur: Some new faces to really bring out a balanced team. We were definitely a bit short on the LN players last year.

**So you guys now have depth to cover most of the issues the UK faced last year right?**

–Dragon–: Yeah definitely. Although we had a bit of a weird qualifiers, we are ready to go as far as possible.

H1Pur: Sure hope so. I feel like we could push past the semifinals finally.

epic man 2: I believe that with the new faces' capabilities on top of our improvements over the past year, I have faith that we could definitely turn more heads this year.

**So you guys will take on Thailand in Ro16. The UK did have a nice run last year, just unfortunately falling short to Hong Kong. What is the UK's realistic goal and how will you strategize to make sure the UK can not only achieve expectations, but also go all the way?**

H1Pur: We have squiddy! They’re insane at gathering information. We can figure out where we are better compared to the other team and what players to expect on what picks thanks to them. They were very accurate with their predictions for the match against Romania. We didn't do much planning or analysis on who we were going against.

epic man 2: Squiddy has shown to be very good with analyzing other players and teams in order to strategize what we should do in the match, which led us to making decisions such as banning a rice pick against Romania given how it was shown that rice was their strongest field.

[ will ]: Squiddy’s information gathering skills will definitely propel the whole team as their analysis allows us to truly see the weaknesses of teams which we can take advantage of :fire: :fire:

_Squiddy_: I also pray that HK somehow beats Taiwan (and Mexico by extension) so that we have a runback rematch, though again unlikely. Apparently some of the HK team members expressed that they can beat Taiwan I've heard, which is interesting.

Realistic goal here would be to try to reach semis or finals in the losers bracket, I think its doable.

–Dragon–: Top 3 would be a pipedream lol. Especially with teams like Vietnam.

_Squiddy_: Realistic goal here would be to try to reach semis or finals in the losers bracket, I think it's doable.

H1Pur: finals is definitely doable this year

**Alrighty, that is it from me! Thank you guys for taking this time and best of luck to you all in Ro16 and the rest of the tournament!**

UK: Thank you!

H1Pur: Pork, can I add in a shout out to Ame please? Thank you.

Hong Kong

**So first off, congratulations on defeating Mexico 5-2! This was not an easy battle as Mexico did take some points off from you guys. What was the strategy heading into the match and did you guys anticipate it to be a hard match?**

popy_gd: Playing Ro32 while being sick is difficult lmao

TheAo0402: Uncertain in terms of SV. I thought we might be able to win but when I saw Mexico protect SV1 I immediately went to do some last-minute practice for it and they ended up picking SV2. I don’t want to talk about what happened on SV2.

pofnkul: I did anticipate it to be a pretty difficult match so I’m pretty happy with a 5-2 win. The strategy was mostly just to pick rice and hope we could take some breakpoints as we were pretty evenly matched with them in general. Funny enough there was a little bit of a strategical blunder due to miscommunication between me and a few other players but it worked out in the end.

[Mom] -So1-: The match was hard. Our nerves played a big role in it.

[Mom] xbob: We figured we could gain points on rice as our seed was far higher than them so our strategy entering the match was to pick as much rice as possible. Also, we had a tough start at qualifiers as I didn't play it because of exams which I was supposed to help on HB, SV and LNs.

Before the match, we thought that we would lose to Mexico as we expected their LN, HB and SV scores were really good. But to our surprise, we managed to get some points off of LNs and we almost outmatched them in SV as well. It was a tough matchup

**(To pofnkul & xbob) So last year, you 2 were a part of the HK roster that finished in Top 6. Now, you guys are only returning, notably missing Misolato, HolySteven, DC2_727, & roy2206. Notable HK Players that participated in previous 4DM tournaments & MWC. What is Hong Kong going to work on in order to get back to where HK went last year?**

pofnkul: Well, having [Mom] -So1- on the team definitely helps a lot. He basically fills the role Misolato filled in the last year. TheAo0402 sort of takes HolySteven’s role and so on and so forth. We may still have “3rd player issue” but I’m feeling quite confident about this team’s ability especially after that first matchup where we did vastly better than I was initially expecting.

[Mom] xbob: To be honest, we don't see ourselves getting very far in this iteration of 4DM, as we lack a much stronger LN and SV roster compared to last year, as core players from last year(e.g. DC2_727, Misolato, Roy and HolySteven) aren't able to participate this year, so I would say our team would need to work on the LN department. However, it's never bad to have good anticipation so I wish our team can reach at least the semi finals.

**Considering you guys have scored an upset victory against Mexico. Your next matchup may be your toughest yet as you'll face #3 Taiwan in the Winner's Bracket! I've heard word around that there is a good chance this team may have a slight chance to pull off the upset. What will be the key components that Hong Kong needs in order to defeat Taiwan?**

TheAo0402: Everyone and I mean everyone having good physical and mental condition during match day. If any one of us are not in good condition we would be in huge trouble.

pofnkul: Consistency is one factor. I feel like lack of consistency hindered our performance during the Ro32 and we’d probably need to play at our absolute peak to pull off that upset. Practicing SV is also going to be a big factor. Our scores can end up pretty evenly matched from time to time so it’ll probably be a matter of who can squeeze out the tiniest bit of advantage over the other.

popy_gd: If i'm completely honest, our winning chances are definitely not high, but if we manage to pull off good and consistent scores and potentially breakpoints especially on LN picks (which is what we’re slightly worse at), then maybe we can have a chance to pull an upset.

[Mom] -So1-: Let’s have fun 1st, winning 2nd.

popy_gd: Yeah, the mappool looks cool ngl.

pofnkul: Honestly, knowing that the winning chance is slim makes me a lot less nervous than I was for Mexico.

popy_gd: That is true as well.

[Mom] -So1-: “Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.” By Thomas Edison

[Mom] xbob: As soon as we keep a good mentality, as well as trying our best to analyze our opponents prior to our match, although the chances of us winning the upcoming matchup are slim, we will try our very best to give them a run for their money. And if we are lucky enough, I think we can get that victory upon our shoulders. It's all about teamwork.

Japan (English)

**So congratulations on winning your match against France! This was a match that went all the way to tiebreaker, but in the end, Japan wins! What is your thoughts after that match?**

faaaaas: It was so much fun! I was very nervous, but I did the best I could.

hashimoto1129: The LN score was so much fun!

AxReo: To be honest, I was really nervous about the tiebreaker...! But thanks to everyone's cheering, I think we were able to win!

**(To AxReo) So this year, you're the only player that's returning from Japan 2023 4DM roster. What's the difference with the 2023 roster to 2024 roster?**

AxReo: 2024 Japan players are stronger on higher SR than last year and more adaptable to different genre maps. I guess the difference is there are also players who are used to playing in tournaments like yoshap!!

**Japan will take on #1 Vietnam in Round of 16 this week. What is Japan's strategy to pull off the win against a tough team? And do you guys think you will win 4DM this year?**

AxReo: Ah yeah of course!!!! WE CAN!!

faaaaas: Of course we'll win. I can get SV for sure, and I have some idea of the members' tendencies from the Ro32 scores.

Japan is not a country to be defeated here.

AxReo: I guess Japan strategy is to use SV as a trump card and... to get a break pointeven from Vietnam like RO32. Because We have the potential to get break point any maps.

hashimoto1129: We just need to do the same thing we did against France, which is to fill the score with spirit and get that score in the real game.

**That's it from me. Thank you for answering the questions!**

Japan: Thank you very much!

Japan (日本語)

**フランス戦の勝利、おめでとう！タイブレークまでもつれた試合でしたが、最後は日本の勝利！試合を終えての感想は？**

faaaaas: めっちゃ楽しかった！！！とても緊張したけど、最大限やれることはやりきったよ〜

hashimoto1129: LN譜面めっちゃ楽しかった！！！

AxReo: 正直タイブレーカーはめっちゃ緊張した...！けどみんなの声援のお陰で勝てたと思います！

**今年は、2023年の4DM日本代表から復帰する唯一の選手ですね。2023年の選手と2024年の選手の違いは何ですか？**

AxReo: 去年よりも高難易度につよかったり、いろんなジャンルの譜面に強いことです！また大会慣れしてるプレイヤーもいることも違いかな？

**日本は今週、ラウンド16で1位ベトナムと対戦する。強豪相手に勝利を収めるための日本の戦略とは？そして、皆さんは今年の4DMで優勝すると思いますか？**

AxReo: もちろんだ! WE CAN!

faaaaas: もちろん勝つよ

SVは確実に取れるし、Ro32のスコアからある程度メンバーの傾向は掴めてるからね

日本はこんなところで負ける国じゃない

AxReo: ラウンド32の時みたいにSVを最期まで取っておくことと、相手のピックをブレイクしに行くことが戦略かな

hashimoto1129: 気合いでスコアを詰めて本番でそのスコアを出す、フランス戦と同じことをすればいいだけ

**私からは以上だ。質問に答えてくれてありがとう！がんばってください**

日本: ありがとうございます!
